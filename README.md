Saw that sweet sweet item that got listed accidentally for 400 Gil, while it should be 400,000 Gil and wondered if you buy it and sell it again, how much profit you would make? You know you pay tax both ways, but how much will you end up with?

This is a simple calculator that will help you figure out how much profit you will make, if you buy an item and sell it again.

To use it, simply enter the price the item is listed in FFXIV Market Board for, and the price you want to sell it for. The calculator will then tell you how much profit you will make, and how much you will end up with after paying the tax both ways.
